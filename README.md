// TO DO LIST (descending order):
// Add unicode characters to phonemeDictionary -- both at indexes, and at incompatibleCharacters array
// Add more combinations of characters in database to search

// split phonemeDictionary into vowels and cons to avoid any potential issues
// Rewire vowel & cons as options for user to select

// Look into unit testing
// bulk database import & assocciated verification of data import - test total number of rowes imported? or total number of 'documents' into firebase?
// tidy up UI (remove header, tree diagram etc)
// optimize UI to display tree - display as new window? maximized window?
// investigate optimization of tree - can we economize on screen real estate by shortening 'gaps' between layers?
// Display user selected chars in dropdown menu -- currently does not show user input values
// doublecheck default view when tree is drawn - is it centered correctly, showing the user the top of thr tree
// add simple instructions?
// redraw button to redraw tree
//intellectual property protection and potential monetisation. Create a function where users can generate handouts as PDFs and charge per action a micro transaction
// UX/UI: make characters in dropdown menu large and easy to see. some characters, especially non unique characters are very similar in appearance. using a larger font will help to prevent user errors
